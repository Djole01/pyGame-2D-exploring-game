By his design it was a 2 player game, which I have converted into singleplayer vs AI.
The level of difficulty is high, the bot opponent is strong while confined to the same rules and settings as the play (speed, nr. of bullets..etc.)

How to play:
- Extract from the archive to desired location 
- cd main
- ./main

movement : WASD
shooting: Spacebar
